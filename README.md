# Berlin Karte

## About
As a designer in Berlin who from time to time works on data visualisations I was fed up by always searching an easy to manipulate Berlin map as SVG, so I  am creating my own with the features I need the most - maybe it is helpful for you too.

It includes paths for:
* city border
* every Bezirk
* every Ortsteil

… and every path can be manipulated to have it’s own stroke and/or fill. 

Currently I am working on giving unique IDs to all the paths and doing some clean up tasks.

## How to Use


## ToDos
- [ ] add meta data in SVG (link to GitHub-Repo and license)
